# Archived ðŸ”’
- This repo is closed for 2 major reasons:
  1. I have lost 2FA credentials to log into my Mozilla account. So there is no possibility for future updates.
  2. The project requires a complete overhaul. Further patches will complicate it unnecessarily.
- I hope `Alter` was able to provide some value.

# Alter
- It is a browser extension, currently available for [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/addon/alter/).
- Alter tries to redirect you to privacy-friendly alternatives.
- As of now it redirects YouTube, Twitter, Reddit, Instagram and Medium links to Invidious, Nitter, Teddit, Bibliogram and Scribe respectively.

### How to download
- Go to https://addons.mozilla.org/addon/alter/

### Alter can "access your data for all websites". Can I trust it?
- Alter watches all urls and and only redirects those that matches its filters.
- It runs completely on your browser. 
- It has no third-party.
- It does not keep any log.
- The source code is completely open source.

### FAQs
*Sometimes it is stuck and do not redirect. What to do?*
- The Alter icon provides you the option to change redirect instances.
- In this case you need to change instance to a different one.

*After update, some redirections are showing undefined. What to do?*
- When new redirection feature is added, no instance is saved for the new feature. So alter does not know where to redirect.
- Click on the Alter icon and submit the form once. You'll be good to go.
